# An ICO web-App built in my course at learnweb3DAO

## The ICO is for CyproDevs NFT holders who had previously minted their NFT's

- the ICO had a total supply of 10000 CD at the price of 0.001 for each token.

- the contract checks if the address has the required NFT and then if yes, mints free ICO tokens to the address depending on the number of nfts the address hold.
  Although the address will have to pay the gas fees needed for the minting transaction.

- addresses that doesnt hold the required nfts, will have to buy at the given price.
